Created for educational purposes.
Dynamically typed imperative language with first-class functions.

Supported values:
* number (integer, double, rational)
* bool (`true` and `false`)

Basic features:
* If expressions
* While expressions
* Simple bool and numbers operators
* Double and rational numbers
* First-class functions (lambda support)

Some more specific examples could be found in the [examples](examples) directory.


TODO:
* Write down Backus-Naur form
  (who cares? but could be great for course-work documentation)
* optimize closures (PRIORITY)
* change `print` expression to be one of builtin functions (PRIORITY)
* `isnull` function
* `nonlocal` keyword (PRIORITY)
* Write down details of Syntax analisys and evaluation rules
