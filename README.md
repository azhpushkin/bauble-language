#### Simple programming languages

![Yeah, this is bubble](/icon.png?s=200)

Created for educational purposes.
Dynamically typed imperative language with first-class functions.

Supported values:
* number (integer, double, rational)
* bool (`true` and `false`)
* `null`
* closures (all functions are first-class and support clojuring)

Basic features:
* Recursion (via `self`)
* If expression
* While loop
* Lambdas and chained calls

Some more specific examples could be found in the [examples](examples) directory.


TODO:
* nonlocal keyword;  -> LATER
* recursion ? (now done with `self` keyword)
